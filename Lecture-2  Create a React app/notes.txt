When we are working with React we have two ways
1) React DOM --> It is used when we are working with Web
2) React-Native ---> It is used when we are working with mobile applications.

How to make react Projects
use npx ---> It is a present in npm(Node package manager) which is a package present in Node. When we want to directly execute the library without installing it then we use NPX (Node package executor)

Command for making react application 
1) npx create-react-app projectRepoName
    create-react-app is a utility means software . This command takes lots of time for installing libraries and it is a bulky utility gives some softwares or libraries which we don't want in our project
        -   for starting project we use command --> npm run start 
            we have more command like build , test , eject 
            when we run npm run build it will give all the static assets of that particular project means html , css, js which is given to users when it goes in production

2) npm create vite@latest 
    vite is a bundler which is work with many libraries and frameworks and we are using vite for making react app            
    Further it ask for more information just select them and complete the process
    - npm i or npm install ---> use this command for creating node modules in vite project which are necessary
    -   for starting project we use command --> npm run start 
            we have more command like build , test , eject 
            when we run npm run build it will give all the static assets of that particular project means html , css, js which is given to users when it goes in production

Package JSON difference between both commands
first command give dependencies which are used for testing and ejecting purpose mostly not required for development purpose
second command gives just two dependencies react and react-dom which are sufficient to create a react project
second command gives more devDependencies which are only used for development purpose
