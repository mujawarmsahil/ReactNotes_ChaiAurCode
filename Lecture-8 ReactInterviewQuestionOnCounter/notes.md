Write a component in which a counter will increase or decrease after hitting buttons
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount(count + 1);
        setCount(count + 1);
    };

    const decrement = () => {
        setCount(count - 1);
        setCount(count - 1);
        setCount(count - 1);
        setCount(count - 1);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increase</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrease</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Counter;
```


```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
    };

    const decrement = () => {
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter-1);
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter-1);
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter-1);
        setCount(prevCounter => prevCounter-1);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increase</button>
            <button onClick={decrement}>Decrease</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Counter;
```

The comments in the code are partially correct but could be clearer. Here's a more accurate explanation:

In the first example, the multiple setCount calls do not result in multiple updates because React batches state updates for performance reasons. Therefore, the counter only increases or decreases by 1.

In the second example, using the functional form of setCount ensures that each update is based on the most recent state, so the counter will increase or decrease by 4 as expected.
